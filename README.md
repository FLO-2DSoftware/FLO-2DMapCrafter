FLO-2D MapCrafter is a QGIS plugin designed to transform FLO-2D output files into comprehensive visualizations. It generates flood maps for single-phase simulations, sediment maps, mudflow maps, and two-phase simulation flood maps. Additionally, MapCrafter goes beyond by creating hazard maps, highlighting areas with elevated risks based on FLO-2D simulations, aiding in risk management. The plugin also streamlines the QGIS layout manager process by automatically generating templates for easy customization.
